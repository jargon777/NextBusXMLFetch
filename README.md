# NextBusXMLFetch
Probably not a useful program.

3 sets of python scripts to do the following:
* Pull AVL data from a NextBus XML feed, in this case configured for a TTC line.
* Pull stop data from a NextBus XML feed, in this case configured for a TTC line.
* Analyse the data pulled and estimate the dwell time at stops.

Documentation in the code is poor, but this code is released under the GPL v2 licence in case it is of any use.
